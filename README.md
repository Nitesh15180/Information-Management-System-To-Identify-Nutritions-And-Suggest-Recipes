# Information-Management-System-To-Identify-Nutritions-And-Suggest-Recipes
* This project requires us to find the nutrients present in fruits and vegetables and to find total food daily intake and food recipes that can be made from those foods or vegetables.

* To develop our system, we needed a method to assess image similarity, enabling us to match user-uploaded images with the closest images in our dataset. We created three distinct datasets and trained our model to minimize error and improve accuracy.
  
* The first dataset includes diverse images of fruits and vegetables to familiarize the system with user requirements. The second dataset contains nutritional information, detailing vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, and calorie content. We compiled this information by scraping data on vegetarian and non-vegetarian ingredients, including high-protein items like fish, chicken, and eggs, as well as minerals such as zinc and magnesium, from various sources.
  
* The third dataset features a variety of recipes, offering users multiple options for meal selection. Our goal is to promote healthy eating by providing users with detailed nutritional information and recipe options. We will employ machine learning techniques for model training and utilize the Stream lit library to create a user-friendly interface, where users can view nutritional information and recipes.

## 1 Source Code:
* The complete and well-documented source code for the image classification application.
* Code for model training and preprocessing scripts.

## 2 Trained Model:
* The final trained model (e.g., FV.h5) that is used for image classification.

## 3 Dataset:
* The labeled dataset used for training, validation, and testing the model.
* Any data preprocessing scripts or notebooks.

## 4 Stream lit Application:
* The fully functional Stream lit application for image classification and nutritional information display.
